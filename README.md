# Huffman-Coding-Representation
Implementation of Huffman Coding using Binary Trees and Calculation of Memory Savings.

In general when characters are stored each character is asigned a 8 Bit storage.
This can be reduced based on the frequency of teh characters in the text.

This projects represents how that can be done and calculates the amount of storage space we can save.
